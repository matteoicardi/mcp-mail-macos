"""Local settings, with sane defaults.

Nothing here has to be configured: every value falls back to something that
works out of the box. Override what you need, in either of two ways.

A `config.json` next to this file — copy `config.example.json` and edit it. It
is gitignored, so local paths never end up in a commit:

    {"drafts_folder": "~/Documents/Outgoing mail", "pending_retention_days": 3}

Or an environment variable, which wins over the file. Handy when the MCP client
passes it in its own configuration:

    MAIL_MCP_DRAFTS_FOLDER="~/Documents/Outgoing mail"

Booleans accept 1/0, true/false, yes/no.
