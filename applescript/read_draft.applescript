-- argv: 1 = account name, 2 = mailbox path, 3 = message id
-- Returns one record: subject, sender, to, cc, bcc, attachment names,
-- mailbox path, account, body, RFC message id.
--
-- The last field is what lets the draft be found again on the server, where it
-- can be sent whole rather than taken apart and composed again.
--
-- Refuses anything that is not a draft. The role is checked against Mail's
-- unified drafts mailbox rather than against a name, since the folder is
-- "[Gmail]/Brouillons" on one account and "Drafts" on another. Matching on the
-- id alone would not do: ids are only unique within a mailbox, so the holding
-- mailbox is compared too, to be sure the draft found is this very message.
